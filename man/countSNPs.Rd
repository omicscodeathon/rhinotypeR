\title{Count pairwise SNPs between aligned DNA sequences}
\usage{
countSNPs(fastaData, deleteGapsGlobally = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastaData}{A [Biostrings::DNAStringSet-class] of aligned DNA sequences.
Sequences must have identical width.}

\item{deleteGapsGlobally}{Logical. If `TRUE`, sites containing gaps (`-` or `.`)
are removed across all sequences before SNP counting. Default: `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of SNP counts with sequence names as dimnames.
}
\description{
Computes pairwise single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) counts between all
sequences in an aligned [Biostrings::DNAStringSet-class] object.
Proportions are computed with [MSA2dist::dnastring2dist()] using the `"IUPAC"`
model (accounts for ambiguous bases), then converted to integer SNP counts.
}
\examples{
if (interactive()) {
  aln <- Biostrings::DNAStringSet(c(Seq1="ATGC", Seq2="ATGT", Seq3="ATGA"))
  countSNPs(aln)
  countSNPs(aln, deleteGapsGlobally = TRUE)
